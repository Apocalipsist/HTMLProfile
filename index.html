                    <h1>Who Am I</h1>
                    <strong><small>I am a photographer looking for new opportunities</small></strong>
                    <p>So as you can tell my name is a little different, to make it easy for everyone involved please feel free to call me Paco. If you would like to call me by my name you can prounounce it as <strong><em>Apo-kah-leap-see</em></strong>. I am from Massachusetts born
                    and raised, my family is originally from Puerto Rico and eventually moved north back in the 60's so we've been New Englanders for a long time. I am always interested in learning new skills and developing myself as a person, father, husband,
                    and friend.  I can do a lot of things weirdly enough, I do Photography on the side, I also cut hair since I went to barbering school almost a decade a go. I have a small family as of right now It consists of my lovely wife Savanna, our son Sebastian and myself
                    I am 29 years old, I was enrolled at a few schools first BYU-I for business (I didnt know what I wanted to do and then) and at Independence University for graphic design, It was a great school but it was shut down last year
                    because the parent company was found embezzling funds.

                    So that was an interesting time. I am now back at BYU-I and I am to studing photography here, it is a huge passion of mine most of the images here will be photos I've taken.

                    <P>I  have had an interesting road and I'm sure many others have had similar journeys. I had an accident 7 years ago that rquired me to have some leg surgeries and it was the worst. I couldn't walk more than a few feet and I was mostly bed ridden
                        for about a year and a half hence the shift from a barber to doing anyhthing else. Since that time I have spent the last 7 years working on my mobility and strength to live a more fufilling life with my family, it was interesting because
                        I had comepletely ruled out any possibility to meet someone and let alone have a family after that first year. I didn't think I could ever walk again either, but I think it was out of keeping those goals in mind and just not giving up I managaed

                        to do both. I have a great wife and Son and I can walk relatively ok with an occasional flair up from time to time. <br><br> <div><hr></div><br> Since then I've tried to just see silver lineings in everything, when everything fell apart I recieved monumental 
                        gifts. Since having our son my determination to provide for him has pushed me to do things that I didn't think I could do.

                    </P>

                    <h1>Why am I here</h1>
                    <strong><small>The basic goal is self improvment</small></strong>
                    <p>With that said the reason I am here today is because of them. I will always put the benefit of my kid first, so when I heard about bootcamps randomly I started to look into any possiblity to better our lives
                        it's not rocket science for me. I just have to keep them in mind and put in the work. I took a Coding class years ago and it was the hardest yet most fun class I had taken. I relaly like the idea of Website creation and solving problems it's 
                        fun to solve problems and I genuenly have loved what I've learn so far.
